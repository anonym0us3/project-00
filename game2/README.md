Racing Game1

Wanted to build a Game of Thrones-y game, that would be stoopid-simple so that I could get my feet wet with thinking things through like this.

Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* jQuery

Existing Features

* 2 player racing
* non-functional background
* non-100%-functional win conditions
* reset button

Planned Features

* I'd like to make my background image work as I want it to
* Would also like to add code preventing a player from being able to move after another player has won
